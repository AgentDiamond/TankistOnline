# TankistOnline > BETA BRANCH
Push commits to this branch, this is the work-in-progress branch. **Full** updates, without any further need of work, may be pushed directly to the Master Branch. Once this branch forms a full update, the Master Branch shall be updated accordingly.

## To-Do:

### Server-Side:
- [ ] Create the server. Because this is lightweight, it has to be single-threaded.

### Client-Side:
- [ ] Create relative XY values for each Tank, in TankClass. This shall allow the viewport to move, to allow maps bigger
      than the window size.
- [ ] Update the screen even if the `on_draw()` event wasn't called.
- [ ] Ensure that the theme is looped, currently when the track ends, it doesn't replay it.

### Misc:

- [ ] Document code more clearly
- [ ] Optimization [it's always welcome, however, keep in mind our Cross-Platform mindset]
- [ ] Creating and maintaining the [Wiki](https://github.com/servusDei2018/TankMMO/wiki)
