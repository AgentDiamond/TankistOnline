The TKO Protocol is the means by which the Tankist Client communicates with the
Tankist Server.


_______________________________
---Client_to_Server protocol---
_______________________________

The client may send the following to the server:

  "tko:newplayer <name>":
    This means a client wants to join as nick <name>

  "tko:rotate +":

    This means the client wants to rotate in a positive direction.

  "tko:rotate -":

    The client wants to rotate in a negative direction.

  "tko:move +":

    The client wants to move forwards. Note that movement is not up/down/left/right, but
    depends on the direction the tank is pointing.

  "tko:move -":

    The client wants to move backwards.

  "tko:shoot":

    The client wants to shoot. The person the shooter hits (if there is one) depends on
    whether there is someone in the way of their bullet (which is determined by the
    direction they're facing).

  "tko:refresh":

    The client needs everyone's X,Y and its own life. This is used when someone new logs into
    a game, that it may update successfully.

_______________________________
---Server_to_Client protocol---
_______________________________

The server may send the following to the client:

  "tko:newplayer <playerName>":

    The client should make note of the new player, and add him to his players pool.

  "tko:xy <playerName> <x> <y>":

    The client should update the X,Y location of the player specified by <playerName>
    to <x>,<y>

  "tko:rotate <playerName> <rotation> <realRotation>":

    The client should update the rotation and realRotation of player <playerName> to
    the values specified.

  "tko:hit <playerName>":

    The client should display a momentary explosion on the player specified.

  "tko:destroy <playerName>":

    The client should remove the player from the game (he's been destroyed).

  "tko:refresh <playerName> <x> <y> <life>"

    Lets all clients know about all other clients.
